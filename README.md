HackDavis 2019 project. The idea of this project was an interactive and accessible AI bot that tracked mood based on spoken and typed-out words, as well as a sleep and water tracker based of information being told. Our goal was to create a web app that encouraged people to keep track of their mental and physical help with ease of access and accessibility.

###Features
- Login with Snapchat account for secrity of data
- Textbox/journal that outputs mood and emotions of users implemented with Google API
###Future Ideas
We planned to implement text-to-speech and speech-to text in order to make this web app more accessible. We also planned to display graphs of the mood changes taken from the Google API that were recorded through conversation, as well as make this a Google Chrome extension for further ease of access. Reminders to sleep and intake water were also planned, as well as a user enviromnent that is easier on the eyes.
